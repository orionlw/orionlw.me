Hot one today and yesterday! 30+ Celsius with high humidity. Thankfully working at the Concrete House today, so will be keeping cool. Yesterday I setup the storage cabinet for concessions at the Al Whittle Theatre, and stocked the fridge. Looking forward to testing out the new (old) popcorn machine. The full trial run is this sunday.
