title: Full Circle Weekend
--- 

I am feeling the exhaustion that comes after a weekend full of music, friends, sun, and time on my bicycle. All that combined with very little sleep has me feeling the full weight of it all. I had a great time, highlights were seeing The Brood (last time was 2017 at the Pav) and Sahara Jane.
