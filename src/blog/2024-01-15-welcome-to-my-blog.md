# Welcome to My Blog

After years of making music, I've decided it's time to start sharing more about the journey. This blog will be a space where I can reflect on my experiences as an electric bassist and composer, share insights about the music I'm creating and listening to, and connect with fellow musicians and music lovers.

## What You Can Expect

I plan to write about a variety of topics that are close to my heart:

- **Bass Playing Techniques**: Tips and thoughts on electric bass performance, from jazz fundamentals to contemporary approaches
- **Composition Notes**: Behind-the-scenes looks at my compositional process, especially in jazz, contemporary classical, and electronic music
- **Musical Discoveries**: Reviews and thoughts on albums, artists, and performances that inspire me
- **Life in Nova Scotia**: How living in Grand Pr√© influences my music and creative process
- **Collaboration Stories**: Experiences working with other musicians, including my work with the Mitchell McFadgen Trio

## Why Now?

Music has always been a deeply personal journey for me, but I've come to realize that sharing that journey can be just as rewarding as the music itself. Whether you're a fellow musician, a music enthusiast, or just curious about the creative process, I hope you'll find something here that resonates with you.

The beautiful landscape of Nova Scotia, with its rich musical heritage and vibrant arts community, provides the perfect backdrop for reflection and creativity. I'm excited to document this chapter of my musical life and share it with you.

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:orionlw@pm.me) or connect with me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@orionlw). Let me know what topics you'd like me to explore or share your own musical experiences.

Here's to new beginnings and the endless journey of musical discovery.
