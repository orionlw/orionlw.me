How can I begin to describe what my experience at the Creative Music Workshop was like? It feels both simple and very complex. I will start by trying.

The takeaway from this week for me was how to connect to creating in the moment. To be able to remove myself from the negative self talk and judgement that happens in my own mind during the act of creation.
