Despite having lived my whole life in the Annapolis Valley, Charles MacDonald was not a figure on my radar until the last couple years. A friend of mine had started a summer job working at a museum in Centreville so I visited. I learned that it was a house hand made out of concrete, and that Charles MacDonald was a vocal socialist. Even in Canada, I learned, even Charlie's not so radical leftist politics could lead to ostrasization and oppression. His concrete workers were paid well (taking what they needed from the company fund), and his cottages in Huntington Point provided affordable lodgings. Right now, I am writing from one of those cottages, the Blue Cottage, which is owned by the foundation that maintains this building and the Concrete House Museum in Centreville.

The Concrete House itself is quite striking in colour and composition, and the grounds are home to interesting statues and art. Likewise, the Blue Cottage is similarly spectacular yet rustic. It was eye opening and potentially mind changing to be introduced to this place. It teaches us that there alternatives to the status quo that can be achieved. Charlie, when he set out, wasn't educated in working with concrete yet he was successful in creating this place that has stood for a hundred years, and is likely to stand for many more if maintained.
